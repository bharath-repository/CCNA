Security Fundamentals

$ Principle of security > CIA
 1)Confidentiality
 2)Integrity
 3)Availability
 
$ Vulnerability, Exploit, Threat, Mitigation

$ Common Attack Types
 1)DoS > availability of a system > TCP SYN flood > in complete connection cos this attack
 2)DDoS > TCP SYN flood > botnet used
 3)Spoofing attacks > fake source address (IP/MAC) > DHCP flood > DHCP Discover message
 4)Reflection/Amplification attacks > 
 5)Man-in-the-middle attack > ARP Spoofing/ARP poisoning > Confidentiality & Intergrity
 6)Reconnaissance attacks > publicly available information > nslookup > whois > 
 7)Malware > malicious software > viruses > worms > trojan horses > 
 8)Social Engineering attacks > Phishing > spear phishing > whaling > vishing > smishing > watering hole > Tailgating
 9)Password-related attacks > Guessing > Dictionary attack > Brute force attack
 
$ Multi-factor authentication
 #Something you know
 #Something you have
 #Something you are
 
$ Digital certificates
 # Entities send CSR to CA > CSR-Certificate Signing Request, CA-Certificate Authority

$ Controlling and monitoring users with AAA
$ ISE - Identity Services Engine > Cisco's AAA server
$ AAA - Protocols
  1)RADIUS > Open standard > UDP 1812/1813
  2)TACACS+ > Cisco's > TCP 49

Port Security

^Feature of cisco switch > control allowed MAC address > by default only one MAC is allowed
^can allow know MAC address
^can restrict number device per interface
     
Violation Modes

    1) Shutdown > 'err-disabled' > Shutdown the interface > Only once Generate Syslog & SNMP message > violation counter 1
    2) Restrict > Discards traffic from unauthoried MAC > interface is Not disabled > Each time will send Syslog & SNMP message > violation counter is incremente by 1 each time
    3) Protect > Discards traffic from unauthoried MAC > interface is Not disabled > Not generate any message > not increment the violation counter
    
    
Secure MAC address aging

  @ By default secure MAC address will not "age out"

Aging type 

  1) Absolute > By default > Based on timer > once timer expiry > will relearn the MAC
  2) Inactivity > Based on each frame > reset the timer for each and every from received
  

Sticky Secure MAC address

>>> Once enable this > Dynamically learned MAC address >> added >> running config >> Manual >> save >> starup config


DHCP snooping

 #filter DHCP message > on untrusted ports
 #by default all ports are untrusted ports
 #other network message & traffic is not affected
 
 @Uplink ports > Trusted ports
 @Downlink ports > Untrusted ports
 
 DHCP attacks
  #DHCP Stravation > spoofed MAC address to flood DHCP discover messages > CHADDR=Client Hardware Address => MAC
  #DHCP Poisoning (Man-in-the-middle) > Spurious server > impersonating like default gateway/router
  
 DHCP Message > dhcp snooping filter message > differentiates between dhcp server & dhcp client messages
  %DHCP server messages > 
   >Offer
   >Ack
   >Nak = used to decline a client request
  
  %DHCP Client
   >Discover
   >Request
   >Release = used to tell the server that the client no longer needs its ip address
   >Decline = used to decline the ip address offered by a dhcp server
   
  %DHCP DORA process
   > Discover
   > Offer
   > Request
   > Ackowledge
   
DHCP Snooping Operation

1) On trusted Port > DHCP message without inspection
2) On Untrusted Port > DHCP server message will be droped
		     > DHCP client message will be inspected 
		     	1)check source MAC & CHADDR if match = forward if not discard
		     	2)check source IP address & DHCP Snooping Binding Table Match = forward if not discard

*By default all ports were untrusted

--------------------------------------------
Dhcp snooping 

Prevent 
Man in the middle 
Dhcp starvation 

By doing 
Trusted and untrusted ports 
Check the untrusted port dhcp offer message and drop it
DHCP messages DHCPACK, DHCPNAK, DHCPOFFER originating from a DHCP server that is not trusted
-----------------------------------------------

DHCP Snooping Rate-Limiting



Dynamic ARP Inspection

 %All ports are untrusted by default
 %Trusted = connection between switches and router 
 %Untrusted = connection towards end hosts

ARP Poisoning (Man in the Middle)

-----------------------------------------------
Dynamic arp inspection 
Prevent 
Man in the middle
Arp snooping 
Actually
Attacker will copy Gateway MAC and act as a Rouge Gateway
Attacker will copy client mac and act as a client 
Trusted and untrusted Port
In untrusted Port 
1) checks dst mac is match with target mac or not 
Match equal forward
Unmatch equal drop 
2) check for dst mac in dhcp snooping table 
If found Matching entry equal forward
Unmatch equal drop

DHCP snooping reads the lease information from the switch (which is a DHCP client) and from this information creates the DHCP snooping database. This database is a mapping between IP address and VLAN-MAC pair. For each VLAN-MAC address pair, the database stores the corresponding IP address

----------------------------------------------


Standard Access Control lists - ACL

	ACL Logic
	ACL Types
	
	
	ACL from a security perspective > function as a packet filter/ instructing the router 
	to permit or discard specific traffic 
	
	ACL can filter traffic based on Source/Destination IP address, source/destination
	Layer 4 ports, etc.
	
	ACL > configured globally on the router > Ordered Sequence of ACE (Access Control
	Entries) > ACL must be applied to an interface > applied either inbound or outbound
	
Implicit deny
	> There is an implicit deny at the end of all ACLs
	> The implicit deny tell the router to deny all traffic that doesn't match any of the 
	configured entries in the ACL.
	
ACL Types
	1)Standard ACL > Match based on source IP address Only
		1)Standard Numbered ACL
		2)Standard Named ACL
	2)Extended ACL > Match based on source/destinations IP, Port, etc
		1)Extended Numbered ACL
		2)Extended Named ACL
		
		
Standard Numbered/Named ACL
	>Standard ACL can use 1-99 and 1300-1999
	>Standard Named ACL has few advantage over numbered ACL.
		1) Can delete any specific ACL entry from a list of entries - using seq number
		2) Can add ACL entry where ever we want - using sequence number
		
Re-sequencing ACL 
	>Helps to edit ACL entry.
	

Extended Numbered/Named ACL
	>Numbered ACL use the following ranges 100-199, 2000-2699
	>They are processed from top to bottom just like standard ACLs.
	
IP protocol number
	> this value you can find inside a IP packet header field
	> Protocol number
		1)ICMP
		6)TCP
		17)UDP
		88)EIGRP
		89)OSPF
