NTP - Network Time Protocol
	Manual time configuration
	NTP basics
	NTP configuration
	
	NTP use port = 123 UDP to communicates
	Stratum 0 = reference clock
	Stratum 1 = 1 NTP server layer (Primary servers)
	Stratum 2 = 2 NTP server layer (Secondary servers)
	
	
DNS = Domain Name System
	Use port 53 UDP/TCP >>> Standard DNS query uses UDP >>> TCP used when the message size is more than 512bytes
	
DHCP = Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
	DHCP server use >>> UDP port 67
	DHCP client use >>> UDP port 68
	
	DORA - Discover, Offer, Request, Ack
	
	Discover > Client to Server > Broadcast
	Offer > Server to Client > Broadcast or unicast
	Request > Client to server > Broadcast
	Ack > Server to client > Broadcast or unicast
	
	Release > Client to server > Unicast
	
DHCP Relay agent
	Helps DHCP client to get IP address from different subnet
	Used in large Enterprise network 

SNMP = Simple Network Management Protocol
	It is used to monitor the status and make configuration changes
	There are two main type of device in SNMP
		1)Managed Device > Device managed by SNMP > switches and routers
		2)Network Management Station (NMS) > SNMP server
		
	SNMP OID's >> Object IDs = iso, identified organization, dod, internet, mgmt, mib-2, system, sysName
	SNMP agent =UDP 161
	SNMP manager =UDP 162
		
SNMP Operations
	1) Managed device can notify NMC of events (NMS = Network Monitoring Software)
	2) NMS can ask managed device to share the current state
	3) NMS can change the configuration for managed device
	
	1)MIB = Management Information Base
	2)SNMP manager
	3)SNMP Agent
	
SNMP Versions
SNMPv1 >> Original version of SNMP
SNMPv2c >> Retrieve large amounts of info in a single request
SNMPv3 >> Strong encryption and Authentication
	
SNMP Messages
Read > Get, GetNext, GetBulk > from NMS to Agent
Write > Set > from NMS to Agent
Notification > Trap (no Ack), Inform (Ack) > from Agent to NMS
Response > Response > both send to each other response message when needed


Syslog

Message Format
seq:time stamp: %facility-severity-MNEMONIC:description

Severity Levels (Every Awesome Cisco Engineer Will Need Ice Daily)
0 > Emergency > System is unusable
1 > Alert     > Immediate action needed
2 > Critical  > Critical conditions
3 > Error     > Error conditions
4 > Warning   > Warning conditions
5 > Notice    > Normal but significant condition
6 > Informational > Informational messages
7 > Debugging > Debug-level messages

Logging locations
1)Console line > By default display all messages (0-7)
2)VTY lines > By default disabled
3)Buffer > syslog messages will be saved to RAM, By default all messages (0-7)
4)External Server > server will receive messages on UDP 514, network device will send the syslog messages to external server

SSH

Console port security
Layer 2 switch management IP
Telnet tcp 23 and SSH tcp 22

Console port security - Login
	> By default = no password required

Secure Shell - SSH
	> v1, v2 
	> Provides security feature such as data encryption and authentication
	> if we use both version in a device means it is like v1.99
	> Must configure hostname and domain name before enabling ssh
	

TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocols)
	> TFTP > Only allows a client to copy a file to or from a server
	> TFTP > No authentication, No ecryption > UDP 69
	> TFTP > every data message will receive ack message from client to server wise versa
	> TFTP Three Phases
		1)Connection
		2)Data transfer
		3)Connection termination
		
FTP
	>TCP 20 & TCP 21
	>username and password used, No encryption
	>FTPS (FTP over SSL/TLS) can be used
	>SFTP (SSH FTP)
	>FTP Control connection TCP 21
	>FTP data connection TCP 20
	>FTP passive mode > client behind the firewall initiates the connection
			  > firewall will block the connection initiated by outside server
			  
			
IOS File systems

	>nvram = used to store = file in the network device 
	>network = used to store = file in the ftp like connected device storage
	>opaque = is a special file system type
	
Static NAT
Source NAT translating source IP address of the device
Static NAT 
>static configuration involved one to one mapping of local IP address to public IP address
>inside local = actual device IPv4 address
>inside global = after NAT preformed the assigned public IP address for a local device

Dynamic NAT
	>Router dynamically maps inside local address to inside global address as needed
	>still here we are using one to one mapping to public ip address > leads to NAT pool 
	exhaustion 
	
PAT (NAT Overload)
	> Translates both IP address and port numbers (if necessary)
	
IP Phones
	>IP Phones > has 3-port switch > one uplink, one down link, one to connect internal
	>Allows PC to connect via IP Phones
	>Recommended to separate voice traffic and data traffic by placing vlans
	
PoE
	>PSE = Power Sourcing Equipments to provide power to PD=Powered Devices over an
	 Ethernet cable
	 
QoS (Quality of Service)
	>is used to priorities between network traffic like voice traffic and data traffic
	
	1)Bandwidth = Overall capacity of the link, can reserve certain amount of bandwidth
		      for certain type of traffic
	2)Delay = one-way delay > time take to travel from source to destination
		= two-way delay > time take to travel from source to destination plus
			          destination to source
	3)Jitter = the variation in one way delay between packets send by the same application
	4)Loss = percentage of packets don't reach their destination
	
	Recommended for acceptable voice call
	1)one-way delay: 150ms or less
	2)Jitter: 30ms or less
	3)Loss:1% or less
	
	QoS - Queuing
	
	1)Tail Drop	
	>By default packet forward to destination FIFO (first in first out) = if the queue is 
	full the next coming all packet will be discarded. It's called tail drop
	2)TCP global synchronization
	>all sending device will decrease the sending speed = Under utilization
	>then gradually all sending device will increase the sending speed = Over utilization
	>To avoid under/over utilization 
		!)TCP sliding window functionality helps to device to increase and decrease 
		network traffic flow depending upon the network congestion 
	
	3)RED (Random Early Detection)
	>To overcome these two problems RED (Random Early Detection) is used to drop specific 
	traffic. so that all other traffic will flow seamlessly.
	>Standard RED all traffic are the same priority
	
	4)Weighted Random Early Detection (WRED)
	>Allows us to control which type of traffic dropped first and second and third

Classification & Marking
Queuing & Congestion
Shaping & Policing

Classification
	-Categories traffic
	-ACL = traffic permitted by ACL will get different treatment then packet dropped by
	ACL
	-NBAR = Network Based Application Recognition = perform deep packet inspection beyond 		 
	layer 4 like upto layer 7  

	-PCP = Priority code point = 802.1q tag can find this field in dot1Q tag frame in a 
	vlan tag. Used to priorities the traffics (layer 2)
	Also know as CoS = Class of Service

	-DSCP = Differential service code point = used for identifying the high/low priority 
	traffic (layer3) = also called IP ToS Bytes
	= DSCP+ECN(Explicit Congestion Notification)
	-DSCP = 6-Bits = 64values
	-IPP = IP Precedence, 6,7=Network traffic (exp: OSPF message between routers), 5=voice
	4=video, 3=voice signaling, 0=Best effort
	
	DF = Default Forwarding
	EF = Expedited Forwarding
	AF = Assued Forwarding
	CS = Class selector

ToS
- 6 bits for DSCP 
- 2 bits for ECN

DSCP

Few marking is been standardized (all vendor and ISP agreed up on this)

1) Default forwarding (DF) - Best effort traffic

2) Expedited Forwarding (EF) - low loss/latency/ jitter traffic (usually voice)

3) Assured Forwarding (AF) - A set of 12 standard values

4) Class selector (CS) - A set of 8 standard values provides backward compatibility with IPP

DSCP Value 0 for normal traffic
DSCP Value 46 for voice traffic

AF 43 = DSCP 38
Given after to DSCP = 8(X)+2(Y)

AF41 = Gets the best treatment
AF13 = Gets the lowest treatment
	
CS (Class Selector)	
	Backward compatibility with IPP 
	
RFC 4954
	>voice traffic: EF
	>interactive video: AF4x
	>Streaming video: AF3x
	>High Priority data: AF2X
	>Best effort: DF

Queuing/Congestion Management
	how queuing works in a router (By examining the DSCP value of the traffic router 
	decide the which queue to choose for a traffic)
	>Input traffic > routing > classify the traffic > put the traffics in the appropriate 
	queue > then scheduler will send as per the available schedule of an interface > and 
	Interface will transmits the traffic.
	
	>weighted round-robin is a common scheduling method
	
	>CBWFQ = (Class-Based Weighted Fair Queuing) > uses > weighted round-robin scheduler
	>each queue will use certain percentage of the interface bandwidth during congestion.
	
LLQ (Low Latency Queuing)
	>designates one or more queue as strict priority queue
	>means > scheduler also send the traffic from the priority queue is empty
	>this method is useful for voice/video traffic
	
Shaping and Policing
	>used to control the rate of traffic
	>Shaping buffers traffic in a queue if the traffic rate goes over the configured rate.
	>Policing drops traffic if the traffic rate goes over the configured rate. The amount
	burst traffic allowed is configurable. > Both cases classification can be used to 
	allow for different rates for different kinds of traffic.
