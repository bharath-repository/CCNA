RIP - Routing information protocol

Multicast address 224.0.0.9
Distance vector - IGP - Routing by rumor logic to learn and share
Uses Hop count as its metric. Max hop count is 15.
RIPv1, RIPv2 for IPv4
RIPng for IPv6
Request and Response
Default share the routes every 30sec

EIGRP - Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol

* Multicast address 224.0.0.10
* Only IGP that can perform Unequal-cost load-balancing
* Use wildcard mask. It is a invert of regular subnet mask

OSPF - Open Shortest Path First

* ECMP - Equal Cost Multi-Path
* Metric value
* Administrative distance 
* Link state routing protocol, Connectivity map
* advertises same network map for all router
* Shortest Path First algorithm / Dijkstra's algorithm
* v1 - not in use *v2 - IPv4 *v3 - IPv6
* LSAs - Link State Advertisements
* LSDB - Link State DateBase
* Internal router - single area
* ABR - Area Border Router - Between areas
* ASBR - Autonomous System Boundary router
* Backbone Router - Area 0 Router
* Intra-area route - same ospf area
* Inter-area route - different ospt area 

OSPF cost
@ metric = cost = calculated based on the bandwidth of the interface
@ cost = reference bandwidth / interface bandwidth
@ default reference bandwidth = 100mbps
@ In ospf >1 will be converted to =1
@ FastEthernet, Gigabit Ethernet, 10Gig Ethernet all are equal cost = 1

OSPF Neighbors
$ Every 10s Hello Multicast message send to 224.0.0.5 = to find ospf neighbor
$ 40sec is dead timer for hello message

Different state of neighbors
%Down > R1,R2 send hello message 224.0.0.5 
%init > Share Router ID with each other
%2-way > R1,R2 will have both Router ID's
%Exstart > (Higher RID become master, Lower RID become slave) DBD - Database description packet
%Exchange > Exchange LSA information > outline
%Loading > LSR,LSU, LSAck > share the LSA information
%Full > all router will have same LSDB

OSPF Network Types
& Broadcast > Ethernet and FDDI
& Point to Point > PPP and HDLC
& Non-Broadcast > Frame Relay and X.25

OSPF Broadcast network type
*Hello message > 224.0.0.5
*DR,BDR,DROther

First election
$ DR-Designated Router  > Port with high priority or Higher Router ID Become DR
$ BDR-Backup Designated Router > Second highest become BDR
$ Once DR down > BDR become next DR immediately 

Second election
255 Higher priority become BDR
0 priority can't be DR or BDR
By default ospf port priority for all ports is = 1


! DR > FULL State
! BDR > FULL State
! DROther > 2WAY  State
! DR and BDR send multicast messages using 224.0.0.6

OSPF Point to Point network type
% Since it is a point to point connection no need DR and BDR

Serial connection
%DCE > Data Communication Equipment > Need to set clock rate
%DTE > Data Temination Equipment

OSPF Neighbor requirements
@ Should be in same area
@ Should be in same subnet
@ Should not shutdown ospf process
@ Router ID should be unique
@ Hello and Dead timer should match
@ Authentication settings must match
@ IP MTU setting must match  > can become neighbor > but doesn't operate properly > 1500bytes
@ OSPF network type must match

OSPF LSA type
Type 1 > Router LSA
Type 2 > Network LSA
Type 5 > AS External LSA


First Hop Redundancy Protocols

*Virtual IP and Virtual MAC
*Active Router and Standby Router OR Active router and Active Router
*Virtual IP act as a default gateway for the LAN
*Active router replies for the ARP Requests
*When switching from standby to active mode the router notify switch using gratuitous ARP message
*If the old active router comes back online. It will become standy router by default
*But we can configure the preemption.

1)HSRP - Hot Standby Router Protocol - Cisco Proprietary
2)VRRP - Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol
3)GLBP - Gateway Load Balancing Protocol

HSRP - Hot Standby Router Protocol
-Cisco Proprietary
-Active and Standby
-Version 1 and Version 2
-Version 2 supports IPv6 and more of default gateway can be created
-Multicast IPv4 V1 = 224.0.0.2
		   = 224.0.0.102
-Virtual MAC address v1=0000.0c07.acXX (HSRP group number)
	 	     v2=0000.0c9f.fXXX (HSRP group number)
-we can configure different active router for different subnet/VLAN to load balance.	 	 

VRRP - Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol
-Open standard
-Master and Backup 
-Multicast IPv4 = 224.0.0.18
-Virtual MAC address = 0000.5e00.01XX (VRRP group number)
-We can configure different master router for different subnet/VLAN to load balance.

GLBP - Gateway Load Balancing Protocol
-Cisco Proprietary
-Load balances among multiple routers withing a single subnet
-Multicast IPv4 = 224.0.0.102
-Virtual MAC address = 0000.5e00.XXYY (xx = GLBP group number, yy = AVF number)
-An AVG (Active virtual gateway) is elected
-One AVG can have 4 AVF(Active Virtual Forwarders) (AVG itself can be an AVF)
-AVF act as a default gateway for a portion of the hosts in the subnets


TCP - Tramission Control Protocol

* End host to End host
* Reliable data transfer
* Data sequence
* Error control
* Flow control

#Identify application layer protocols
#Support session multiplexing

IANA = Internet Assign Number Authority
Well Know Ports = 0 - 1023
Registered ports = 1024 - 49151
Dynamic/Private ports = 49152 - 65535
