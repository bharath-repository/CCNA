WAN - Architectures

	Extends over large geographic area > Geographically separate LANS > VPN used to create private WAN connections

	1) WAN over dedicated connection (Leased Line) > Dedicated physical link > use serial connection (PPP or HDCL encapsulation) > High cost, High installation time, Slower speed 
	2) WAN connection via Ethernet (Fiber)
	3) WAN over shared infrastructure (Internet VPN) > Single Homed, Dual Homed, Multihomed, Dual Multihomed
	
MPLS - Multi Protocol Label Switching -WAN connection via Ethernet (Fiber)
	& Layer 2.5 > MPLS label is kept between L2 address and L3 address header 
	& CE router = Customer Edge Router, PE = Provider Edge router, P router = Provider core router
	& PE router add the MPLS label > CE Router don't run MPLS label
	1) Layer 3 MPLS VPN > CE and PE router peer using OSPF > ISP share routing table to CE
	2) Layer 2 MPLS VPN > CE and PE router don't form peering > ISP router act as a big switch between CE routers
	
Internet VPNs
	1) Site to Site VPNs using IPsec > Encrypt the normal IP packet > append > VPN header, New IP header > create IPsec VPN Tunnel > Sending device combine original packet & session key & runs them through encryption formula > Tunnel is create between two router from different sites
		
		Limitations > 
		can't do broadcast and multicast > only unicast > resolved by GRE over IPSec
		full mesh tunnel > is labor intensive task > resolved by Cisco DMVPN 
		
		1) GRE over IPsec > Generic Routing Encapsulation > it will encapsulate the GRE info >
		Don't encrypt the info > 
		Normal packet > GRE info > IPSec Info
		
		2) DMVPN > Dynamic Multipoint VPN > allows routers to dynamically create a full mesh of
		IPsec tunnels 
	
	2) Remote-access VPNs using TLS > use to access the company service from end device securely > Transport Layer Security > TLS VPN tunnel > 
	
	
Virtualization

	1) Type 1 Hypervisor > Run directly on hardware > Like Microsoft Hyper-V, VMware ESXi > used in 
	data centre
	2) Type 2 Hypervisor > Run on a OS system > VMware workstation, Oracle VirtualBox > used in 
	personal use
	
	> Host OS > Guest OS
	> Partitioning , Isolation, Encapsulation, Hardware independence
 

Cloud Services
	
	1) On-Premises > all servers and infrastructure are located on company property

Intro to wireless network security
Authentication Methods
Encryption/Integrity methods
Wifi Protected Access (WPA)

Authentication Methods
	1)Open Authenticaion > Client send auth req > AP accepts all req > not secure
	2)WEP - (Wired Equivalent Privacy) > provides auth & encryption > uses RC4 algorithm for encryption
	3)EAP - (Extensible Authentication Protocol) = 802.1X > Supplicant, Authenticator, Authentication server > RADIUS server
	4)LEAP - (Lightweight EAP) = client & server both send challenge phrase to each other, authenticate using username and password
	5)EAP-FAST - (EAP Flexible Authenctication Via Secure Tunneling) = 1) Protected Access Credential 2) Encrypted TLS Tunnel 3) Authentication
	6)PEAP (Protected EAP) = 1)Digital cert 2)Encrypted TLS tunnel 3) Authenticate
	7)EAP-TLS (EAP Transport Layer Security) = 1)Digital Certificates from Both end 2)Encrypted TLS tunnel
	

Encryption methods
	1)TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol) = Advanced version of WEB, Used in WPA ver1
	2)CCMP (Counter/CBC-MAC Protocol) = Used in WPA2 > 1)AES (counter mode = Encryption), 2) CBC-MAC (Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code) MIC = Message integrity check
	3)GCMP (Galois/Counter Mode Protocol) = Used in WPA3 > 1)AES 2) GMAC for MIC
	
WPA - Wireless Protect Access
	1)WPA > TKIP, 802.1X
	2)WPA2 > CCMP, 802.1X
	3)WPA3 > GCMP, 802.1X > PMF (Protected Management Frames) > SAE (Simultaneous Authentication
	of Frames = protect 4way handshake when using personal mode auth) > Forward secrecy (Prevent 
	data from being decrypted after it has been transmitted over the air)
	
	1)Personal mode = PSK-pre shared key used to auth > use four way handshake
	2)Enterprise mode = 802.1x is used with auth server (RADIUS server)
