Network switching techniques
	1)Circuit switching - satellite com -  dedicate path b/w device
	2)Packet switching - internet - transmit over the network independently
	3)Message switching - Before packet switching we used it - now no more
	
Network switching methods
	1)Store-and-forward - Here the switch will store entire frame and > forward
	2)Cut-and-through   - Here the switch will until it receive dest MAC > forward
	3)Fragment-free     - Here the switch will until it receive 64byte > forward

VLANs - Virtual Local Area Networks
	What is trunk port
	Purpose of trunk ports
	802.1Q Encapsulation = VLAN tagging 
	Configure trunk port
	Router on a stick (ROAS)
	
	802.1Q Tag
		1)TPID - Tag Protocol Identifier > 16bits, 0x8100 value set always > 
			 meaning dot1Q
		2)TCI - Tag Control Information
			1)PCP -Priority code Point > 3 bit CoS - Class of Service - used 
			for prioritizes	the traffic
			2)DEI - Drop Eligible Indication > 1bit - indicate - 
			        can be dropped if the 
			network is congested
			3)VID - Vlan ID > 12bits - identifies the VLAN 
			
		Native VLAN
			Native Vlan should match between switches trunk ports
			VLAN 1 is by default native VLAN

STP - Spanning Tree Protocol
	Redundancy in networks
	1) To avoid Broadcast storms
	2) To avoid MAC address flapping
	
	Classic Spanning Tree Protocol is IEEE 802.1D
	
STP - Spanning Tree Protocol
	To prevent loop - placing redundant ports in a blocking state
	1) Interfaces in a forwarding state behave normally
	2) Interfaces in blocking state only allow BPDUs = Bridge Protocol Data units
	3) All port on the root bridge in a forwarding state 
	
	Root Bridge selection
		1) By default -- Lowest MAC switch become -- root bridge of the network
		
	Root Port selection
		1) Lowest root cost
		2) Lowest neighbor bridge ID
		3) Lowest neighbor port ID


STP - Spanning Tree Protocol =  STP will run in a switch by default
	STP states
		Blocking = stable, 
		forwarding = stable, 
		listening=transitional, 
		Learning=transitional
		
		Blocking state
		>Non-designated ports are in a blocking state
		>Interface in blocking state = helps us prevent loops = don't send/receive regular traffic
		>Interface in blocking state receive BPDUs. don't forward STP BPDUs. don't learn MAC
		
		Listening state
		>Designated and root port in listening state
		>Listening state is 15 sec long by defualt > set by forward delay timer
		>Listening state interface only send/receive STP BPDUs > do nothing with regular traffic > it doesn't learn about MAC from regular traffic
		
		Learning state
		>After the listening state, a designated or root port will enter the learning state.
		>Listening state is 15 sec long by defualt > set by forward delay timer
		>Interface > Only send/receive STP BPDUs > don't send/receive regular traffic
		>Interface > Learns > MAC address from regular traffic
		
		Forwarding state
		>Root and Designated ports are in a forwarding state
		>Interface in the forwarding state operate as normal
		>Interface send/receive normal traffic, BPDUs, Learns MAC address
		
		A port in the forwarding state performs as follows:
		•Forwards frames that are received from the attached segment
		•Forwards frames that are switched from another port for forwarding
		•Incorporates station location information into its address database
		•Receives BPDUs and directs them to the system module
		•Processes BPDUs that are received from the system module
		•Receives and responds to network management messages
		
		
	STP Timers
		>Hello = Often the root bridge send the hello BPDUs = every 2 seconds
		>Forward delay switch will stay in listening and learning states = 30secs
		>Max Age = How long an interface will wait after ceasing to receive Hello BDPUs to change the STP topology. = 20secs
		
		
	STP BPDU
		
	
	STP Optional features
		>Portfast >Portfast = used for end host ports only > it will change the port directly from blocking to forwarding state
		>BPDU Gaurd
	
	STP configuration
	
STP (802.1D) Port State - Disabled -> Blocking -> Listening -> Learning -> Forwarding

RSTP (802.1w) Port State - Discarding -> Learning -> Forwarding
	
	
Rapid spanning Tree Protocol

	1) Comparison of STP versions (Standard vs cisco)
	2) Rapid PVST+ = Rapid Per Vlan Spanning Tree Plus = Encapsulation with dot1q
	
	RSTP Port states
	1)Discarding
	2)Learning
	3)Forwarding
	
	RSTP Port Roles
	1)Root
	2)Designated
	3)Alternate
	4)Backup
	
	RSTP Optional feature	
	1) Portfast = used for end host ports only > it will change the port directly from blocking to forwarding state
	2) UplinkFast = helps to move immediate to forwarding = from alternate port to root port
	3) BackboneFast =  
	
	Protocol version identifire in STP = 0
	Protocol version identifire in Rapid STP = 2
	
	Classic STP > root bridge only generate BPDUs
	Rapid STP > All switch will generate BPDUs
	
	All switches running Rapid STP send own BPDUs every Hello time (2 seconds)
	Classis STP > wait for 10 hello intervals 2seconds * 10intervals = total 20 sec 
	Rapidd STP > wair for 3 hello intervals 2sec*3interval = 6sec, then flush all MAC address learned on that interface
	
	Industry standards (IEEE)
		Spanning tree protocol (802.1D)
			> the original STP
			> all Vlan share one STP instance > so can't load balance
		
		Rapid spanning tree protocol (802.1W)
			> Much faster at converging/adapting to network changes than 802.2D
			> all Vlan share one STP instance > so can't load balance
			
		Multiple spanning tree protocol (802.1S)
			> uses modified RSTP mechanics.
			> can group mutiple vlans into different instance (1-5 vlan instance 1, 6-10 in instance 2) = can perfor load balancing for large networks
			
	
	Cisco versions
		Pre-Vlans Spanning Tree Plus
			> Each Vlan has different instances = can do load balance
		
		Rapid Per-Vlan Spanning Tree Plus
			> cisco upgrade to 802.1w
			> Each Vlan has different instances = can do load balance
		
	RSTP Link Types
		1)Edge = for end host > moves directly to forwarding
		2)Point to Point = a direct connection between two switches
		3)Shared = a connection to a hub, must operate in half-duplex mode
		
		
Ether Channel = Port channel = Link aggregation group

	Configuring Layer 2/ Layer 3 Etherchannels
	LACP = Link Aggregation Control Protocol
	Port selection calculations done by Source MAC and Destination MAC
	Up to 8 interfaces can be formed into a single etherchannel.
	In LACP allows upto 16 interfaces but only 8 will be active the other 8 will be in standby mode

	There are three methods of ether channel configuration.
	
		1)PAgP (Port Aggregation Protocol) > Cisco Proprietary protocol > Dynamically negotiates the creation/maintenance of the etherchannel
		>auto+auto = no etherchannel
		>desirable+auto=etherchannel
		>desirable+desirable=etherchannel
		
		2)LACP (Link Aggregation control protocol) > IEEE 802.3ad > Dynamically negotiates the creation/maintenance of the etherchannel.
		>passive+passive=no etherchannel
		>active+passive=etherchannel
		>active+active=etherchannel
		
		3)Static Etherchannel > Interfaces are statically configured to form an etherchannel
		>on+on=etherchannel
		>on+desirable= no etherchannel
		>on+active=no etherchannel
		

Layer 3 Etherchannel


Layer 2 Discovery Protocols (CDP & LLDP)
CDP - is a cisco proprietary protocol
	>CDP - Cisco Discovery Protocol
	>CDP messages are periodically sent to Multicast MAC address 0100.0CCC.CCCC
	>CDP messages are sent once every 60 sec by default
	>CDP messages isn't receive from neighbour CDP holdtime is 180 sec after that 
	neighbour will removed from CDP neighbour table
	>CDP has version1 and version2 > by default we are using version2
	
		
LLDP - is a industry standard protocol (IEEE 802.1AB)
	>LLDP - Link Layer Discovery Protocols
	>By default disable on cisco devices
	>A device can run CDP and LLDP at the same time
	>LLDP messages are periodically sent to Multicast MAC address 0180.C200.000E
	>LLDP messages are sent once every 30 sec by default
	>LLDP messages holdtimer is 120 sec
