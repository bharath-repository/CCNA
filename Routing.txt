Routing
	1)Static Routing
	2)Dynamic Routing

Routing Priority
	-longest prefix length
	-small administrative distance
	-small metrix = cost
	
Dynamic Routing

-Interior Gateway Protocol - Within a Single AS
-Exterior Gateway Protocol -  Between Different As
IGP - Distance Vector - RIP
                      - EIGRP
    - Link State - OSPF
                 - IS-IS
EGP - Path vector - BGP

Administrative Distance

Directly connected/Linked - 0
Static - 1
eBGP - 20
EIGRP - 90
IGRP - 100
OSPF - 110
IS-IS - 115
RIP - 120
EIGRP (external) - 170
iBGP - 200

RIP - Routing information protocol

Multicast address 224.0.0.9
Distance vector - IGP - Routing by rumor logic to learn and share
Uses Hop count as its metric. Max hop count is 15.
RIPv1, RIPv2 for IPv4
RIPng for IPv6
Request and Response
Default share the routes every 30sec

EIGRP - Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol

* Multicast address 224.0.0.10
* Only IGP that can perform Unequal-cost load-balancing
* Use wildcard mask. It is a invert of regular subnet mask

OSPF - Open Shortest Path First

* ECMP - Equal Cost Multi-Path
* Metric value
* Administrative distance 
* Link state routing protocol, Connectivity map
* advertises same network map for all router
* Shortest Path First algorithm / Dijkstra's algorithm
* v1 - not in use *v2 - IPv4 *v3 - IPv6
* LSAs - Link State Advertisements
* LSDB - Link State DateBase
* Internal router - single area
* ABR - Area Border Router - Between areas
* ASBR - Autonomous System Boundary router
* Backbone Router - Area 0 Router
* Intra-area route - same ospf area
* Inter-area route - different ospt area 

OSPF cost
@ metric = cost = calculated based on the bandwidth of the interface
@ cost = reference bandwidth / interface bandwidth
@ default reference bandwidth = 100mbps
@ In ospf any value <1 will be converted into =1
@ FastEthernet, Gigabit Ethernet, 10Gig Ethernet all are equal cost = 1 with reference bandwidth of 100

OSPF Neighbors
$ Every 10s Hello Multicast message send to 224.0.0.5 = to find ospf neighbor
$ 40sec is dead timer for hello message

Different state of neighbors
%Down > R1,R2 send hello message 224.0.0.5 
%init > Share Router ID with each other
%2-way > R1,R2 will have both Router ID's
%Exstart > (Higher RID become master, Lower RID become slave) DBD - Database description packet
%Exchange > Exchange LSA information > outline
%Loading > LSR,LSU, LSAck > share the LSA information
%Full > all router will have same LSDB



OSPF Network Types
& Broadcast > Ethernet and FDDI
& Point to Point > PPP and HDLC
& Non-Broadcast > Frame Relay and X.25

OSPF Broadcast network type
*Hello message > 224.0.0.5
*DR,BDR,DROther

First election
$ DR-Designated Router  > Port with high priority or Higher Router ID Become DR
$ BDR-Backup Designated Router > Second highest become BDR
$ Once DR down > BDR become next DR immediately 

Second election
255 Higher priority become BDR
0 priority can't be DR or BDR
By default ospf port priority for all ports is = 1


! DR & BDR > FULL State > with all routers in the subnet
! DROther > 2WAY  State > with other DROthers in the subnet
! DROther > FULL State > with DR/BDR in the subnet
! DR and BDR send multicast messages using 224.0.0.6

OSPF Point to Point network type
% Since it is a point to point connection no need DR and BDR

Serial connection
%DCE > Data Communication Equipment > Need to set clock rate
%DTE > Data Temination Equipment

OSPF Neighbor requirements
@ Should be in same area
@ Should be in same subnet
@ Should not shutdown ospf process
@ Router ID should be unique
@ Hello and Dead timer should match
@ Authentication settings must match
@ IP MTU setting must match  > can become neighbor > but doesn't operate properly > 1500bytes
@ OSPF network type must match

OSPF LSA type
Type 1 > Router LSA
Type 2 > Network LSA
Type 5 > AS External LSA


First Hop Redundancy Protocols

*Virtual IP and Virtual MAC
*Active Router and Standby Router OR Active router and Active Router
*Virtual IP act as a default gateway for the LAN
*Active router replies for the ARP Requests
*When switching from standby to active mode the router notify switch using gratuitous ARP message
*If the old active router comes back online. It will become standy router by default
*But we can configure the preemption.

1)HSRP - Hot Standby Router Protocol - Cisco Proprietary
2)VRRP - Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol
3)GLBP - Gateway Load Balancing Protocol

HSRP - Hot Standby Router Protocol
-Cisco Proprietary
-Active and Standby
-Version 1 and Version 2
-Version 2 supports IPv6 and more of default gateway can be created
-Multicast IPv4 V1 = 224.0.0.2
		V2 = 224.0.0.102
-Virtual MAC address v1=0000.0c07.acXX (HSRP group number)
	 	     v2=0000.0c9f.fXXX (HSRP group number)
-Active and Standby router = Hello 3Sec & Hold time 10Sec
-we can configure different active router for different subnet/VLAN to load balance.	 	 

VRRP - Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol
-Open standard
-Master and Backup 
-Multicast IPv4 = 224.0.0.18
-Virtual MAC address = 0000.5e00.01XX (VRRP group number)
-We can configure different master router for different subnet/VLAN to load balance.

GLBP - Gateway Load Balancing Protocol
-Cisco Proprietary
-Load balances among multiple routers withing a single subnet
-Multicast IPv4 = 224.0.0.102
-Virtual MAC address = 0000.5e00.XXYY (xx = GLBP group number, yy = AVF number)
-An AVG (Active virtual gateway) is elected
-One AVG can have 4 AVF(Active Virtual Forwarders) (AVG itself can be an AVF)
-AVF act as a default gateway for a portion of the hosts in the subnets


TCP - Tramission Control Protocol

* End host to End host - Connection-oriented
* Reliable data transfer - Destination host must ack 
* Data sequence - Sequence number in the TCP header
* Error control
* Flow control - Destination host can feedback about the data flow to source 

#Identify application layer protocols
#Support session multiplexing

IANA = Internet Assign Number Authority
Well Know Ports = 0 - 1023
Registered ports = 1024 - 49151
Dynamic/Private ports = 49152 - 65535

TCP Header

1) Source & Destination Ports
2) Sequence number and Ack Number
3) Flag Bits - Ack, Syn, Fin & (Window Size - Flow control)

Establishing TCP connection - Three way handshake

1) Syn flag - From server 1
2) Syn flag, Ack Flag From server 2
3) Ack flag - From server 1

Terminating TCP connection - Four way handshake

1) Fin flag - From server 1
2) Ack flag - From server 2
3) Fin flag - From server 2
4) Ack flag - From server 1

UDP - User Datagram Protocol

* Not Connection-oriented
* doesn't provide reliable communication
* doesn't provide the sequencing
* doesn't provide flow control

TCP - Downloading file
UDP - Voice and Video call


IPV6 Addressing

* 128 Bit address

Global Unicast Address (Public IPv6 Address)

* Can be used over internet
* Has 64-Bits for Host portion
* Has 48-Bits for Network portion
* Has 16-Bits for IPv6 subnets 
* 2000::/3 to 3FFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF
* Currently starts with "2000"

Unique Local Address (Private IPv6 Address)

* Can't be used over internet
* FC00::/7 (FC00:: to FDFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF)
* Currently starts with "FD"

Link Local Address (Automatically Generated)

* It will automatically generated on IPv6-enabled interface
* FE80::/10 (FE80:: to FEBF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF)
* Currently starts with "FE8"

Multicast Address

* FF00::/8 (FF00:: to FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF)
* IPv6 doesn't use broadcast But it is actived by multicast

Multicast Address Scopes

* Interface-local > FF01
* Link-local > FF02
* Site-local > FF05
* Organization-local > FF08
* Global > FF0E

Anycast Address

* One to One of Many
* In a network few Routers will have same ip address = Which alow the router to take shortest path 
for the routing as per the metric

EUI-64

* Extended Unique Identifire
* Use 48-Bit Interface MAC address in host portion
	1) Seperate the 48-Bit Mac address into two half
	2) Replace FFFE in the middle
	3) Change the 7th-Bit from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0 
	
Other IPv6 Address

* "::"  >> Unspecified address
* "::/0"  >> this is like in ipv4 0.0.0.0 >>> Default route configuration
* "::1"  >> this is like in ipv4 127.0.0.0/8 >>> Loopback address


IPv6 Repesentation

# must use lower case letter
# must "0" portion with "::"
# must from left to right priority for this same length "0" to make "::"
# only once we allowed to use "::"

IPv6 Header > 40 bytes

& Version > 4 bits
& Traffic Class > 8 bits > QoS > IP phone traffic, Live video call, etc will give priority over other traffic
& Flow label > 20 bits > communication between a specific source and destination
& Payload Length > 16 bits > the encapsulated layer 4 segment > 
& Next Header > 8 bits > indicates the type of the next header for example TCP or UDP (payload - header)
& Hop Limit > 8 bits > same function as the ipv4 header's TTL field.
& Source / Destination address > 128 bit > each > IPv6 address

Solicited-Node Multicast Address

* solicited-node multicast address - calculated from a unicast address
* "ff02::1:ff" + "Last 6 hex digits of unicast address"

NDP - Neighbor discovery protocol

 ARP = NDP
 ICMPv6 to use like ARP

# Two message type
	1) Neighbor Solicitation (NS) = ICMPv6 Type 135  >> like ARP Request >>> is a multicast 
	2) Neighbor Advertisement (NA) + ICMPv6 Type 136 >> like ARP Reply >>> is a unicast
	
# NDP allows hosts to automatically discover routers on the local network.
	Two message type
	1) Router Solicitation (RS) = ICMPv6 Type 133 >> multicast address FF02::2 (All routers)
	2) Router Advertisement (RA) = ICMPv6 Type 134 >> multicast address FF02::1 (All nodes) >> respone to RS message

# SLAAC >> Stateless Address Auto-configuration
	1) Learn prefix length using RS/RA message

NDP >>> DAD - Duplicate Address Detection

@ When router port is enabled >> it will send a NS message to the port IPv6 address 
	>if it doesn't get a reply >> it is unique
	>if it does get a reply >> router this IPv6 address is a duplicate


IPv6 Static Routing 

! By dafult ipv6 routing is disabled. Must enable ipv6 routing manually

1) Directly attached static route
2) Recursive static route
3) Full specified static route
4) Floating Static route = This routes AD value should be higher than main route AD value

Note: 
	* Directly attached static route wouldn't work in IPv6
	* Directly attached static route works with IPv4
